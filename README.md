# Language Interpreter - WIP

Following through the book 'Creating an Interpreter in Go' by Thorsten Ball in order to learn Go and have a better understanding of parsing, lexing, and evaluating.

This will have typical data types and allow recursive function calls, but I would like to implement loop iteration, static typing, as well as full Unicode support.
