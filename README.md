# Language Interpreter

Following through the book  'Creating an Interpreter in Go' by Thorsten Ball in order to learn Go and have a better understanding of interpreters/lexers/and parsers.

This will have typical primitive data types and allow recursive function calls, but I would like to implement loop iteration.
